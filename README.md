# 1984 Redux
A modification for the Paradox Interactive game, "Hearts of Iron IV"

## Getting Started
**We recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) to download**;
it provides an easy way to synchronize with the latest changes. If it is
inconvenient to download, or you do not want to sign up, you can use another
Git client (like [Sourcetree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree)) or
just download a ZIP archive.

### ...with GitHub Desktop
1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
2. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join), and sign into GitHub
   Desktop.
3. Click File â†’ Clone Repository; in the dialog box, under URL insert
   `https://github.com/Buggy347/1984redux`. and clone it into
   `Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod`, under your user's Documents
   folder. Start the cloning process by clicking "Clone".
4. Open the new folder using a file explorer. Drag `1984.mod`
   into the `mods` folder.
5. Start up HOI4, and select "1984 Redux".
(If this does not work, make sure that the folder inside of the "/mod" folder is named 1984, github sometimes screws this up)

#### ...with another Git client
*This guide presumes that this client is set up and configured.*

1. Clone `https://github.com/Buggy347/1984redux` into
   `Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod`, under your Documents folder.
2. Copy the repository's `1984.mod` into the `mods` folder.
(If this does not work, make sure that the folder inside of the "/mod" folder is named 1984, github sometimes screws this up)

### ...without using Git
**Warning:** You may fall behind from the latest version of the mod. Make sure
to check this page often, and redownload.

1. Download the [ZIP file](green button in top right) for the mod.
2. Extract the ZIP to `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod`.
3. Copy "1984.mod" to `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod`.
4. Start up HOI4, and select "1984 Redux".
(If this does not work, make sure that the folder inside of the "mod" folder is named 1984, github sometimes screws this up)
