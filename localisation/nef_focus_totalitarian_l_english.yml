 ####### ARMY
 nef_tot_reform_the_army_desc:0 "Our land forces are currently led by the corrupt and unimaginative, our soldiers are under-trained and under-equipped, and our technology has grown stagnant. Let's shake things up."
 nef_tot_our_countrys_pride_desc:0 "Brave young men are volunteering by the millions to take up arms against our enemies. Freedom for all from the oppression of ignorance will be won by the blood of these heroes."
 nef_tot_tiny_training_world_desc:0 "Reviews of our military indoctrination procedures have discovered process improvements that will shorten our training periods significantly. We should implement these immediately."
 nef_tot_sheep_to_slaughter_desc:0 "Post-revolution population growth measures are starting to come into effect. We will increase our conscription efforts to get more bodies to the front, faster."
 nef_tot_equal_opportunity_desc:0 "For some women, their duty is to create life. For others, it is to destroy it. We are an equal opportunity nation, and we can think of no better way to honor our country's women than to allow them to die on the battlefield in as equal numbers as the men."
 nef_tot_desperate_times_desc:0 "The front lines are thinning. But we have plenty of young and old ready to join the fight, and it is fitting that their educations and retirements can be spent destroying the enemies of our people."
 nef_tot_desperate_measures_desc:0 "We have sent millions of our own citizens to their deaths, yet millions more must die. Defeat is not an option, even if it requires sending our crippled and broken back into the fray.\n\nWARNING: The stability loss from this focus may be enough to cause your capitulation if this focus is taken at the brink of defeat."
 nef_tot_queen_of_battle_desc:0 "Wars are won only with boots on the ground. Whether from the air, the sea, or on their own two legs, our infantry forces will march to victory."
 nef_tot_sticks_and_stones_desc:0 "Focusing on the mass-production of infantry equipment will put more rifles in more hands, potentially freeing up industrial capacity for more advanced equipment... or just increase our head count at the front."
 nef_tot_old_dogs_desc:0 "We must improve our results with the resources we have available. Commanders will be held accountable for their failures and rewarded for their successes. Regular performance reviews will ensure we capitalize on best practices moving forward."
 nef_tot_what_makes_grass_grow_desc:0 "Blood! Blood makes the grass grow!\n\nLet us divert more resources towards the advancement of our infantry equipment and increase our soldiers' lethality on the battlefield."
 nef_tot_supporting_cast_desc:0 "Rifles and boots are not enough. Our individual units will be more effective with the right supporting units."
 nef_tot_high_speed_low_drag_desc:0 "Specialized units can give us a great advantage in certain situations where ordinary infantrymen would fail. Only our best and brightest will qualify for these units."
 nef_tot_path_to_glory_desc:0 "The path to glory is laid before us. We must only drive forward to reach victory."
 nef_tot_king_of_battle_desc:0 "'Artillery adds dignity to what would otherwise be an ugly brawl.'\n- Frederick the Great"
 nef_tot_no_guns_no_glory_desc:0 "Inadequate numbers of supporting batteries will put our infantry at risk. We must divert resources towards streamlining our production of cannons and ammunition."
 nef_tot_willy_pete_desc:0 "By introducing white phosphorus (among other payloads), variable timed fuses, and sophisticated fire direction control, we can improve the decisiveness of our fire support elements through simply reforming our current doctrine."
 nef_tot_smells_like_victory_desc:0 "Artillerymen have an interesting name for the smell of cordite. Inappropriate as it may be, we should focus on improving our technology to make the big booms even bigger."
 nef_tot_mountain_gods_desc:0 "Mountain warfare poses trouble for artillery, hampering our ability to find effective firing solutions but more importantly reducing our ability to move guns. Some technological innovation can solve the latter problem."
 nef_tot_jungle_rats_desc:0 "Our special operations units could benefit from a new type of explosive that can clear a path through the jungle, allowing them to move faster and strike the enemy harder."
 nef_tot_keys_to_victory_desc:0 "We have the keys to victory in our hands. We must simply open the door and walk through."
 nef_tot_tanks_for_your_service_desc:0 "Antiquated armor technology is a recipe for disaster. To win, we must be faster, stronger, and better-protected."
 nef_tot_instruments_of_death_desc:0 "Creating and resupplying armored divisions will take up a very significant proportion of our industry. We can at least lessen this blow by focusing on our design processes to facilitate mass-production."
 nef_tot_concentration_of_force_desc:0 "Overall numbers matter little when you can use them more effectively at the right place and the right time. We should reform our doctrine to help us focus more on the decisive action of breaking through the enemy lines."
 nef_tot_my_tank_is_fight_desc:0 "Our tanks are the best tanks. All other tanks are worthless in comparison."
 nef_tot_bleeding_edge_desc:0 "Getting ahead of the curve can give us an absolutely massive advantage... until the enemy catches up."
 nef_tot_ironclad_legions_desc:0 "Armor is worthless without infantry support. We must ensure our infantry forces are capable of both keeping up with our armor and surviving enemy contact. Focusing on the mass-production of mechanized equipment will pay us back in dividends."
 nef_tot_winning_strategies_desc:0 "We have the strategies needed to win this war. We must simply put them into practice."
 nef_tot_no_horseplay_desc:0 "It seems the horse is no longer a viable combat vehicle. Let us not be left in the dust with our forefathers, or we shall join them in the grave."
 nef_tot_maneuver_improver_desc:0 "Speed is everything. Whether it comes to reinforcing weak points in the line or to overtaking an enemy position, violence of action must be equalled in violence of maneuver.\n\nA reform of our methods and procedures can be made which will enable units to move cohesively at a faster rate."
 nef_tot_there_will_be_blood_desc:0 "The doctrine of Mass Assault is not simply about quantity over quality. Improving our logistics, focusing our efforts, and allowing our forces to be flexible - these doctrines will enable us to move more quickly and decisively to destroy the enemy."
 nef_tot_ghost_of_clausewitz_past_desc:0 "Should we approach war as a mathematical problem, and applying critical analysis to our operations in an effort to achieve the greatest success with the minimal resources, we can focus on what is really needed and achieve the greatest results on a large scale."
 nef_tot_fire_and_brimstone_desc:0 "Flames do not need much encouragement to spread; simply provide a combustible material and some oxygen and it will take care of the rest. Our forces, if provided with the right materials to maximize their lethality, should be flexible enough to achieve victory without the need for excessive bureaucracy and hand-holding."
 nef_tot_unto_the_breach_desc:0 "Maneuver without fires is suicidal. Fires without maneuver is indecisive. Focusing on the interaction of these elements of war will enable us to overcome even the most determined enemy."
 
 ####### NAVY
 nef_tot_reform_the_navy_desc:0 "The Ministry has conducted a review of our naval situation and has determined that, with the current status of our fleet and our established doctrine, we are ill-equipped to deal with any future naval threats. The time has come to address this."
 nef_tot_little_boats_desc:0 "Screening ships are cheap to build, but are useful for patrolling trade routes, detecting and destroying enemy submarines, and for providing a threat to larger ships when massed in large numbers."
 nef_tot_big_boats_desc:0 "Heavy cruisers and battlecruisers provide a good amount of firepower for the cost and are ideal for protecting smaller patrols, raiding distant convoy routes, providing limited fire support to coastal ground actions, and for destroying enemy screens en masse in fleet actions."
 nef_tot_bigger_boats_desc:0 "Capital ships form the backbone of our fleet. While many could argue battleships are becoming obsolete, they can be extremely effective when the enemy is denied air cover. Carriers can be ultimately decisive and are best used in areas with limited ground aircraft coverage, especially from the enemy."
 nef_tot_run_silent_run_deep_desc:0 "Submarines, while not very useful in most situations, can be extremely effective when it comes to punishing our rivals for their mistakes. Attacking isolated convoy routes are the obvious use, but they can also tie up enemy fleets if our technology and doctrine have evolved enough."
 nef_tot_heavy_metal_desc:0 "Super-heavy battleships are extremely expensive to build, but can turn the tide in a straight-up shooting match between fleets. As long as the enemy is denied the use of torpedo bombers, very few opponents can penetrate the armor of these ships."
 nef_tot_surprise_party_desc:0 "When the door is locked tight, the burglar will find the window. We must open new fronts in this war where the enemy may least expect us. Naval invasions bring unique challenges in planning and logistical support, so it will take some effort to make sure these attacks can be successful and sustainable on a larger scale."
 nef_tot_sir_long_lancealot_desc:0 "Our destroyers and submarines are vulnerable when faced with direct fire from enemy guns. A whole new layer of possibilities open up when we can extend their lethality to a longer range. Long range torpedoes are almost guaranteed to produce results."
 nef_tot_run_them_down_desc:0 "Just as importantly as in ground warfare, maneuvering our ships more effectively than the enemy can prove to be decisive in itself. Being able to avoid their long range artillery or to hold them at the mercy of ours... the benefits cannot be overstated."
 nef_tot_fire_for_effect_desc:0 "A small shell that hits its target is infinitely more useful than a large one that misses. Let's work on our gunnery training to ensure our small and large shells alike can strike true."
 nef_tot_life_preservers_desc:0 "Retreat is cowardice, but breaking contact is strategic. Whether to conserve a damaged capital ship or to break off of less important engagements, it would be foolish of us to, out of hubris, deny our commanders a practiced battle drill for retreating."
 nef_tot_hoist_the_jolly_roger_desc:0 "Our navy may not prove to be decisive in our victories to come, but by utilizing our resources effectively we can deny the enemy the use of their own. We must move quickly and strike hard to starve their economy."
 nef_tot_bigger_is_better_desc:0 "These seas belong to us. Even while at port, the very existence of our fleets can deny the enemy access to crucial sea zones. Should they venture into them, we must be prepared to destroy them with decisive action."
 nef_tot_force_projection_desc:0 "Across the globe, our fleets will bring a reckoning to the enemy wherever we may find them. The ability to project our power across the seas will cause the enemy to hesitate, never knowing where we may strike next."
 
 ####### AIR FORCE
 nef_tot_reform_the_air_force_desc:0 "In the great war it became apparent that air power was the way of the future. But since then, our air force has stagnated. Our pilots lack experience and their aircraft are antiquated. We must make changes to survive the wars ahead."
 nef_tot_delete_boats_desc:0 "Warships are expensive to replace. Why risk our battleships when a small plane with a torpedo can send them back to the shipyard for months, or even send them to the bottom of the sea? Our current bomber and torpedo designs may get the job done, but to really command the sea we will need to do better."
 nef_tot_roaring_eagles_desc:0 "Controlling the air may be the most crucial task our air force may face. All other aircraft are worthless when they cannot take to the skies without being sent back to the ground in a ball of fire. We need to ensure these skies belong to us."
 nef_tot_close_air_support_desc:0 "The roar of an approaching attack aircraft or the chopping rotors of a helicopter gunship can be a soldier's greatest relief or darkest fear. The best protection we can afford our armies is to destroy theirs from the sky with impunity."
 nef_tot_death_from_above_desc:0 "Tactical and strategic bombing open up new options for our commanders, and can often mean the difference between victory and defeat in a long, protracted war."
 nef_tot_smoke_on_the_water_desc:0 "Bringing the perfect ratio of fighters to torpedo bombers can sometimes be the difference between victory and defeat. But it always helps if our aircraft are just plain better than theirs."
 nef_tot_doctrinal_review_desc:0 "Now that technology is advancing somewhat, we can make some adjustments to our air doctrine to best utilize these new aircraft. We should hold a summit with our scientists and commanders, taking statistics and first-hand accounts from the war fighters in order to improve our performance on a large scale."
 nef_tot_low_life_expectancy_desc:0 "Post-battle analysis has concluded that the average life expectancy of our pilots is quite low unless we have a far superior number of fighters. We should adjust our production methodology and pilot training programs to account for this. Not every plane needs to be built to last, and not every pilot must be the Red Baron."
 nef_tot_quality_craftsmanship_desc:0 "Our pilots have been heroic in their efforts. To give them nothing but the best equipment would put their talents to waste. We should draft a policy to focus on improving the craftsmanship of our aircraft across the board."
 nef_tot_honor_in_death_desc:0 "To die for one's cause is the greatest act of honor and selfless service that one can make. These martyrs will never be forgotten. Should they expect to die, we expect all of our pilots to make the most of it and take the enemy down with them."
 nef_tot_top_gun_desc:0 "The remarkable skills of some of our pilots cannot be put to waste. Should you choose, we have drafted a pilot rotation program to bring our best and brightest home to train a new breed of dogfighters. Furthermore, there are some more improvements we can make to our aircraft to give them an edge over the enemy."
 nef_tot_best_practices_desc:0 "Taking the many lessons we have learned, there are some more improvements we can make to our doctrine."
 
 ####### MINIPLENTY
 nef_tot_ministry_of_plenty_desc:0 "Miniplenty controls our domestic industry and in turn rations consumer goods for our population. We will bring them to the brink of starvation and death, yet they will love us for it."
 nef_tot_concrete_jungles_desc:0 "To wage global war, we will need a great industry. Putting some focus on improving our construction methods will pay off in the long term."
 nef_tot_one_year_plan_desc:0 "Now that our attention is undivided, it is the best time to begin a great project to rebuild our country. Within one year, our industry must be ready for war."
 nef_tot_victory_goods_desc:0 "Slowly but surely, the state has been taking control of various corporations that serve the consumer market, establishing monopolies, reducing product quality, then diverting resources towards our military industrial complex. Nobody will know the difference, and nobody will care."
 nef_tot_state_capitalism_desc:0 "All across the horizon, one can see clearly the smoke stacks of our factories like monuments to our greatness. But we can be even greater."
 nef_tot_industrial_strength_victory_desc:0 "The backbone of our war efforts. We must focus our efforts on streamlining our manufacturing processes across the country. Eliminate waste, increase efficiencies, and shorten supply chains."
 nef_tot_war_machine_desc:0 "We must continue to focus on our industry in order to be prepared for war. After all, winning wars is nothing more than getting the best tools to the right people at the right time. We're going to need more tools."
 nef_tot_unpaid_overtime_desc:0 "Education, recreation, and sleep do very little to serve the war effort. Our citizens will gladly forgo such luxuries in order to allot more time toward building tanks and war planes."
 nef_tot_adapt_and_overcome_desc:0 "Our soldiers' needs are changing rapidly. We have developed new processes that should ensure rapid production changes among most of our military equipment, but this means we can't skimp out on our labor force."
 nef_tot_coal_of_duty_desc:0 "All inefficiencies must be eliminated. The public use of natural resources must be further rationed and strict recycling policies will be enforced. Failure to adhere to this edict is a betrayal to the Party and to the Nation."
 nef_tot_beans_and_bullets_desc:0 "Our industry has made great strides, but the operational aspects involved in transporting supply and materiel to the front lines have plenty of opportunities for improvement."
 nef_tot_strength_through_sacrifice_desc:0 "We simply don't have the time to find other means of providing resources to our consumer industry. We must enact a new decree to seize the resources we need, now. The people will understand."
 nef_tot_unnatural_resources_desc:0 "The previous regimes, no doubt under the vile influence of Emmanuel Goldstein, have squandered our homeland's natural resources. Our war machines desperately require oil, so through the love of the Party we will create our own!"
 
 ####### MINITRUE
 nef_tot_ministry_of_truth_desc:0 "Who controls the past, controls the future. All information in every form flows through Minitrue, where historical records are altered to become the new reality."
 nef_tot_final_indoctrination_desc:0 "The only truths in this world are the ones we have written. Ignorance is the shield that will protect our society, and our truths will be the hammer that will smash our enemies to pieces for the good of the Party."
 nef_tot_doublethink_desc:0 "'To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them... Even to understand the word—doublethink—involved the use of doublethink.'"
 nef_tot_unpersons_desc:0 "Our leadership is completely infallible, but we must always learn from our mistakes. The traitors among us will be erased from history. Through doctored photos, revisions of documents and books, and a thorough removal of any trace of these individuals, it will be as if they had never existed."
 nef_tot_inspect_your_gadgets_desc:0 "New advances, such as the microchip, are only the beginning. As the supreme controllers of information, we will need to stay ahead of the curve with computing technology."
 nef_tot_secrets_are_no_fun_desc:0 "We employ spies and scouts, but the amount of information traveling freely through the air means it is necessary that we create sophisticated codes along with a means of deciphering those of our enemies."
 nef_tot_civil_defense_battalions_desc:0 "New advancements in radar mean we can quickly organize our militias at home to respond effectively to air raids. Setting up a system of early warning and target identification will go a long way towards defending our critical infrastructure as well as keeping morale up."
 nef_tot_flak_boats_desc:0 "Radar technology is becoming increasingly important. Focusing on the development of smaller seaborne dishes can give our naval anti-air crews a vital advantage when defending against aircraft."
 nef_tot_the_dark_arts_desc:0 "Certain ethical procedures may be overlooked to gain an advantage in the arms race. It may be late in the game, but at this point, every advantage is crucial. Especially the unsavory ones."
 nef_tot_nuclear_reproliferation_desc:0 "Not long ago, global thermonuclear war had nearly exterminated all life on Earth. In the end, these weapons were not banned through treaties, but through expenditure, and the refineries and scientists behind the carnage were 'expended' as well. Today, the time has come for us to re-split the atom and wield these weapons once again."
 nef_tot_depleted_uranium_desc:0 "A useful byproduct of our resurgence as a nuclear power. Depleted uranium ammunition has impressive armor-piercing capabilities and will aid us in destroying enemy armor."
 nef_tot_unrestricted_armaments_desc:0 "Certain weapons were previously considered too cruel and barbaric to be used by anybody except for terrorists and petty dictators. Now we must use all of the most deadly armaments available to us, and to consider less is defeatism at best."
 nef_tot_high_on_violence_desc:0 "The pharmacy is open! Our troops will march for days without exhaustion, and they will attack the enemy with such a psychotic fury that they will resemble rabid dogs. The body count is about to rise."

 ####### MINILOVE
 nef_tot_ministry_of_love_desc:0 "We will torture them. Any who oppose us, any who dare commit thoughtcrime and harbor deviancy from our great society, we will torture them and we will crush these thoughts until nothing is left but Love for the Party."
 nef_tot_surveillance_state_desc:0 "The architecture of our buildings should support the elimination of privacy. In the short term, we can start with expanding our national police telescreen network. Who would argue against sleeping soundly at night, knowing they are guarded from criminals and terrorists?"
 nef_tot_assimilation_desc:0 "It will take time to fully assimilate the conquered populations into our society. Thousands of years of culture and language cannot be wiped out in the blink of an eye. But for the short term, there are options."
 nef_tot_thought_police_desc:0 "Keeping tabs on our citizens is not enough. We need to build networks upon networks of informants, and even the smallest hint of Party disloyalty must be acted upon without hesitation."
 nef_tot_reprogramming_desc:0 "We can seperate families, burn their homes to the ground, and grind their civilizations into the dust, but will they then still fight for us? Our scientists have made a proposal for a set of experiments that aim to make this a reality."
 nef_tot_room_101_desc:0 "Men struggle to retain their own identity, their own consciousness, but we have the means of breaking it. With this final step, we can mold their individual thoughts to our will. When we are finished, we will tell them that 2 + 2 = 5, and they will believe it with the wholehearted conviction as if they had seen it with their own eyes."
 nef_tot_feed_the_meatgrinder_desc:0 "Applying advanced methods of social psychology can help us create psychotic socialists. If we can convince our soldiers, battered and bloody as they are, to willingly return to the fray without a moment's hesitation, then we will undoubtedly be victorious."
 nef_tot_not_one_inch_desc:0 "With what we have accomplished, it should be easy for us to amplify this biological desire to protect one's homeland. We will beat it into their heads, that they cannot give one inch of ground to our enemy, and they must drive the invaders out or die trying."
 nef_tot_two_minutes_hate_desc:0 "Hatred is a strong emotion. The act of an entire nation joining together to embrace this emotion, all at once, is a powerful uniting force and a great testament to our successes."
 nef_tot_purge_defeatism_desc:0 "Have we suffered some setbacks? No. We are stronger than ever. Any voices that acknowledge our losses should be silenced immediately. There is no room for defeatism in this great society."
