 nef_sticksstones_desc:0 "Focusing on the mass-production of infantry equipment will put more rifles in more hands, potentially freeing up industrial capacity for more advanced equipment... or just increase our head count at the front."
 nef_olddogs_desc:0 "We must improve our results with the resources we have available. Commanders will be held accountable for their failures and rewarded for their successes. Regular performance reviews will ensure we capitalize on best practices moving forward."
 nef_nogunsnoglory_desc:0 "Inadequate numbers of supporting batteries will put our infantry at risk. We must divert resources towards streamlining our production of cannons and ammunition."
 nef_willypete_desc:0 "By introducing white phosphorus (among other payloads), variable timed fuses, and sophisticated fire direction control, we can improve the decisiveness of our fire support elements through simply reforming our current doctrine."
 nef_instrumentsdeath_desc:0 "Creating and resupplying armored divisions will take up a very significant proportion of our industry. We can at least lessen this blow by focusing on our design processes to facilitate mass-production."
 nef_concentrationforce_desc:0 "Overall numbers matter little when you can use them more effectively at the right place and the right time. We should reform our doctrine to help us focus more on the decisive action of breaking through the enemy lines."
 nef_ironlegions_desc:0 "Armor is worthless without infantry support. We must ensure our infantry forces are capable of both keeping up with our armor and surviving enemy contact. Focusing on the mass-production of mechanized equipment will pay us back in dividends."
 nef_maneuverimprover_desc:0 "Speed is everything. Whether it comes to reinforcing weak points in the line or to overtaking an enemy position, violence of action must be equalled in violence of maneuver.\n\nA reform of our methods and procedures can be made which will enable units to move cohesively at a faster rate."
 nef_longlance_desc:0 "Our destroyers and submarines are vulnerable when faced with direct fire from enemy guns. A whole new layer of possibilities open up when we can extend their lethality to a longer range. Long range torpedoes are almost guaranteed to produce results."
 nef_runemdown_desc:0 "Just as importantly as in ground warfare, maneuvering our ships more effectively than the enemy can prove to be decisive in itself. Being able to avoid their long range artillery or to hold them at the mercy of ours... the benefits cannot be overstated."
 nef_fireforeffect_desc:0 "A small shell that hits its target is infinitely more useful than a large one that misses. Let's work on our gunnery training to ensure our small and large shells alike can strike true."
 nef_lifepreservers_desc:0 "Retreat is cowardice, but breaking contact is strategic. Whether to conserve a damaged capital ship or to break off of less important engagements, it would be foolish of us to, out of hubris, deny our commanders a practiced battle drill for retreating."
 nef_lowlifeexpectancy_desc:0 "Post-battle analysis has concluded that the average life expectancy of our pilots is quite low unless we have a far superior number of fighters. We should adjust our production methodology and pilot training programs to account for this. Not every plane needs to be built to last, and not every pilot must be the Red Baron."
 nef_qualitycraftsmanship_desc:0 "Our pilots have been heroic in their efforts. To give them nothing but the best equipment would put their talents to waste. We should draft a policy to focus on improving the craftsmanship of our aircraft across the board."

 nef_oneyearplan:0 "One Year Plan"
 nef_victorygoods:0 "Less is More"
 nef_victorygoods_desc:0 "Slowly but surely, the state has been taking control of various corporations that serve the consumer market, establishing monopolies, reducing product quality, then diverting resources towards our military industrial complex.

 nef_patrationing:0 "Less is More"
 nef_patrationing_desc:0 "We have already converted large portions of our industry to focus on the production of materiel for our armed forces. Now we have nationalized further portions of our industry away from consumer manufacturing so we can better prepare ourselves against the impending invasion. Our people will be subjected to severe rationing, but the people will understand that forgoing the luxuries of the present is necessary to protect the liberties of the future."
 nef_upot:0 "All Work and No Play"
 nef_upot_desc:0 "Education, recreation, and sleep do very little to serve the war effort. Our citizens will gladly forgo such luxuries in order to allot more time toward building tanks and war planes."
 nef_adaptovercome:0 "Changer Management"
 nef_adaptovercome_desc:0 "Our soldiers' needs are changing rapidly. We have developed new processes that should ensure rapid production changes among most of our military equipment, but this means we can't skimp out on our labor force."
 nef_beansbullets:0 "Beans and Bullets"
 nef_beansbullets_desc:0 "Our industry has made great strides, but the operational aspects involved in transporting supply and materiel to the front lines have plenty of opportunities for improvement."
 nef_strengthsacrifice:0 "Party Resources"
 nef_strengthsacrifice_desc:0 "We simply don't have the time to find other means of providing resources to our consumer industry. We must enact a new decree to seize the resources we need, now. The people will understand."
 nef_unnaturalresources:0 "Oil for Blood"
 nef_unnaturalresources_desc:0 "We have depleted most of the natural oil and rubber resources in our homeland. The need for these materials is critical, so we will be making heavy investments into creating more synthetic refineries as quickly as possible."

 nef_civildefense:0 "Eyes in the Sky"
 nef_civildefense_desc:0 "New advancements in radar mean we can quickly organize our militias at home to respond effectively to air raids. Setting up a system of early warning and target identification will go a long way towards defending our critical infrastructure as well as keeping morale up."
 nef_flakboats:0 "Flak Attack"
 nef_flakboats_desc:0 "Radar technology is becoming increasingly important. Focusing on the development of smaller seaborne dishes can give our naval anti-air crews a vital advantage when defending against aircraft."
 nef_depura:0 "D.U."
 nef_depura_desc:0 "A useful byproduct of our resurgence as a nuclear power. Depleted uranium ammunition has impressive armor-piercing capabilities and will aid us in destroying enemy armor."
 nef_unrarm:0 "Geneva What?"
 nef_unrarm_desc:0 "Certain weapons were previously considered too cruel and barbaric to be used by anybody except for terrorists and petty dictators. Now we must use all of the most deadly armaments available to us, and to consider less is defeatism at best."
 nef_unrarm2:0 "Geneva What?"
 nef_unrarm2_desc:0 "Certain weapons were previously considered too cruel and barbaric to be used by anybody except for terrorists and petty dictators. Now we must use all of the most deadly armaments available to us, and to consider less is defeatism at best."

 nef_survstate:0 "Telescreens"
 nef_survstate_desc:0 "The architecture of our buildings should support the elimination of privacy. In the short term, we can start with expanding our national police telescreen network. Who would argue against sleeping soundly at night, knowing they are guarded from criminals and terrorists?"
 nef_assimilation:0 "Welcome Pamphlets"
 nef_assimilation_desc:0 "It will take time to fully assimilate the conquered populations into our society. Thousands of years of culture and language cannot be wiped out in the blink of an eye. But for the short term, there are options."
 nef_thoughtpolice:0 "Truth, Exposed"
 nef_thoughtpolice_desc:0 "Keeping tabs on our citizens is not enough. We need to build networks upon networks of informants, and even the smallest hint of Party disloyalty must be acted upon without hesitation."
 nef_reprogramming:0 "Brainwashing"
 nef_reprogramming_desc:0 "We can seperate families, burn their homes to the ground, and grind their civilizations into the dust, but will they then still fight for us? Our scientists have made a proposal for a set of experiments that aim to make this a reality."

 nef_feedmeat:0 "Hatred is Love"
 nef_feedmeat_desc:0 "Applying advanced methods of social psychology can help us create psychotic socialists. If we can convince our soldiers, battered and bloody as they are, to willingly return to the fray without a moment's hesitation, then we will undoubtedly be victorious."
 nef_notoneinch:0 "Hatred is Love"
 nef_notoneinch_desc:0 "With what we have accomplished, it should be easy for us to amplify this biological desire to protect one's homeland. We will beat it into their heads, that they cannot give one inch of ground to our enemy, and they must drive the invaders out or die trying."

 nef_twf:0 "The Ghost of Clausewitz Past"
 nef_twf_desc:0 "A more efficient defense allows resources to be diverted to a stronger offense elsewhere. A review of our fortifications and defensive tactics will be of great use to our fighting men and women."
 nef_tdarts:0 "Ethics, Shmethics"
 nef_tdarts_desc:0 "Certain ethical procedures may be overlooked to gain an advantage in the arms race. It may be late in the game, but at this point, every advantage is crucial. Especially the unsavory ones."
 nef_ideofanat:0 "Divine Wind"

 nef_finalindoc:0 "Truth, Redefined"
 nef_fearhope_desc:0 "The overlords' armies are at the gates and it is only a matter of time until they put our resolve to the test. Our borders closed to refugees long ago, but we have allowed just enough to trickle through so that they may spread the message of fear. We must capitalize on this fear to unite the populace. We shall resist the invaders until our very last breath!"
 nef_drumwar_desc:0 "Tensions are rising and it appears the invasion is nearly upon us. The masses huddle together in horror, but with the right motivations, we can turn that into hatred. Every step an enemy soldier takes into our lands, we shall leave a pile of his comrade's corpses in his wake."
 nef_decindep_desc:0 "'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed... with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'\nThe opportunities for diplomatic solutions ended many years ago, but by boldly proclaiming our sovereignty in the face of overwhelming power, we can perhaps garner domestic support for our efforts."
 nef_natthought_desc:0 "Technology is evolving at a rapid pace. Many of the world's brightest minds have already fled to our country, but we must take control of them and focus the minds of all educated men and women on creating greater weapons and tactics to destroy the enemy and keep our people free."
 nef_strsac_desc:0 "Our people are starving, but we require more industrial resources to support our military efforts.
