 nef_council.1.t:0 "The Grand Council"
 nef_council.1.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is in chaos. The industry is in complete shambles and the armed forces are led by individuals who more closely resemble local warlords than professional commanders. There is no unity here, and it won't be long before the great powers come to enslave us.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has decided to call a Grand Council, summoning military, industry, and community leaders from across the country to set his agenda and get the country back on track."
 nef_council.1.a:0 "Let's hope this is worthwhile."
 nef_council.2.t:0 "Preliminary Conference"
 nef_council.2.d:0 "It will take some time to get all of our leaders here, but time is our most precious resource. The politicans and community leaders will not be here for several days, but we may be able to hold meetings with our military commanders before they get here.\n\nOn the other hand, representatives of our most influential businesses are easily accessible, and we certainly have some items to address with them. Your call."
 nef_council.2.a:0 "Assemble the chiefs of staff."
 nef_council.2.b:0 "Summon the business leaders."
 nef_council.3.t:0 "The Chiefs of Staff"
 nef_council.3.d:0 "Our highest ranking commanders have gathered in your conference room and are awaiting your guidance. We have many things to discuss, but what should we focus on?\n\nThere are lot of war preparations to be made. We can start putting these into place now rather than waiting for after the grand council.\n\nIt may be worthwhile to make a demonstration of who is in charge here. Some who have been critical of your policies could be made to disappear. But I have concerns about going down this path."
 nef_council.3.a:0 "Let us prepare for war."
 nef_council.3.b:0 "I demand obedience!"
 nef_council.4.t:0 "A Small Purge"
 nef_council.4.d:0 "Sir, on your orders we have quietly liquidated some of your loudest critics among the general staff. The rest of them have pledged their undying loyalty to you."
 nef_council.4.a:0 "It had to be done."
 nef_council.5.t:0 "The Titans of Industry"
 nef_council.5.d:0 "The most influential business leaders of [Root.GetName] have assembled in your conference room. We have a few days to try to sort out some of the issues they're facing, but we need to go in there with our priorities straight.\n\nThere are some executive options on the table for sorting out the mess with our military acquisitions. It should improve our overall production capabilities.\n\nIf you would like, we have the power to seize control of several industrial complexes in the name of national security, but I have concerns about the message this will send."
 nef_council.5.a:0 "Focus on our bottom line."
 nef_council.5.b:0 "We need those factories."
 nef_council.6.t:0 "State Industry"
 nef_council.6.d:0 "It was a test of your authority, and you've passed. Those affected must have realized that they are powerless to stop us. I believe that with the threats currently facing us, many will actually be reassured to to see a leader taking such a decisive action."
 nef_council.6.a:0 "Very good."
 nef_council.7.t:0 "The Refugee Question"
 nef_council.7.d:0 "The Grand Council has begun. After a few days of heated debate over minor issues, the various leaders of our country have accepted your authority and we can now begin making larger decisions.\n\nThe first priority issue on the table is the current refugee crisis. We can continue accepting refugees from the totalitarian states, but this could open us up to foreign infiltration, not to mention the price of feeding this many people. On the other hand, there are many who would be willing to defend their new homes, and there are also plenty of educated people we could make use of."
 nef_council.7.a:0 "Continue accepting refugees."
 nef_council.7.b:0 "Shut the borders down."
 nef_council.8.t:0 "The Reconstruction Question"
 nef_council.8.d:0 "The Grand Council continues. Most of the issues do not require your immediate attention, but one question has come up regarding a large-scale reconstruction project.\n\nSome outlying towns have been evacuated in the past which contained a high concentration of industrial infrastructure. It is currently in shambles, though. There are also some old fortifications built for a previous war that have fallen into disrepair. We have the resources to solve one of these problems."
 nef_council.8.a:0 "Reopen the factories."
 nef_council.8.b:0 "Rebuild the fortifications."
 nef_council.8.c:0 "Rebuild the fortifications."
 nef_council.8.z:0 "Rebuild the fortifications."

 nef_council.9.t:0 "The Mercenary Question"
 nef_council.9.d:0 "The council meetings have turned toward our national security situation. The warlords in attendance have vowed their full support in the wars to come and they have pledged their armies to you, to make use of as you please. But how will we make use of them?\n\nCombined, the warlords can offer us several thousand fighters. They may be under-equipped but they are experienced and ready for battle. Alternatively, we could use their most experienced fighters to set up training schools and allow us to deploy more conscripts, faster."
 nef_council.9.a:0 "We need more soldiers."
 nef_council.9.b:0 "Our soldiers need to train."
 nef_council.9.c:0 "We need more soldiers."

 nef_council.10.t:0 "At an Impasse"
 nef_council.10.d:0 "The council deliberations have come to an abrupt halt. A government in wartime cannot function like this. I can see the fear in everybody's eyes. It is obvious we need to take some drastic action. Right now your support has never been greater, so let's make a decision.\n\nThere is only one option. If the council were to grant you legally-binding emergency powers, you could enact some drastic reforms which could potentially save our people. Enough talk!"
 nef_council.10.a:0 "Request emergency powers."
 nef_council.10.b:0 "I don't request, I demand!"
 nef_council.11.t:0 "Emergency Powers Granted"
 nef_council.11.d:0 "After a small period of debate, the Grand Council of [Root.GetName] has passed a new legal document granting [Root.GetLeader] full emergency executive powers for the next six years, to be extended automatically should a state of war exist."
 nef_council.11.a:0 "Thank you."
 nef_council.12.t:0 "Emergency Powers Secured"
 nef_council.12.d:0 "After some heated exchanges resulting in several community leaders being escorted from the room, the Grand Council of [Root.GetName] has reluctantly passed a new legal document granting [Root.GetLeader] full emergency executive powers for the next six years, to be extended automatically should a state of war exist."
 nef_council.12.a:0 "It's about time."
 nef_council.13.t:0 "What Next?"
 nef_council.13.d:0 "Now that you are clearly in control of this council, what is next on the agenda? I recommend we begin the process of drafting a new constitution in order to safeguard the future of this country.\n\nOn the other hand... perhaps this council has met the extent of its usefulness. There are still some very loud critics out there, but dealing with them would depend on how much 'support' you have gained from your recent decisions as well as how far you are willing to go. With them out of the way, this council would serve no further purpose than as a rubber stamp to your policies."
 nef_council.13.a:0 "We will need a new constitution."
 nef_council.13.b:0 "This council is a formality."
 nef_council.13.c:0 "This council is a formality."
 nef_council.21.t:0 "The Promise"
 nef_council.21.d:0 "Under the current state of emergency, we cannot hold our government accountable to its people. There is simply no time for it. When these wars are over, the world will be a very difference place, and we will need a new constitution.\n\nToday, you have made a pledge before all that, should we be victorious, we will hold a constitutional convention that ensures we have a government that is to be held accountable by the people for the preservation of human rights and dignity."
 nef_council.21.a:0 "Freedom or death!"
 nef_council.14.t:0 "Military Intervention"
 nef_council.14.d:0 "Soldiers with written orders from your high command have arrested several politicians and community leaders who had previously spoken out about your growing influence. There is now no question about your authority."
 nef_council.14.a:0 "They are loyal to me."
 nef_council.15.t:0 "Police Raid"
 nef_council.15.d:0 "Under charges of treason, the chief of police has overseen the arrest of several politicians and community leaders who had previously spoken out about your growing influence. Their protests to the wealthy elite have gone unheard, as nobody is willing to cross you out of fear for reprisals."
 nef_council.15.a:0 "They know better."
 nef_council.16.t:0 "Our Message"
 nef_council.16.d:0 "The council is coming to a close. The time has come to turn from words to actions. As these leaders return to their communities, they can bring a message of hope to the people, and show them that the light of their future still burns should they fight for it.\n\nOn the other hand, it would be simpler to spread the message of fear. If the people realize the true extent of the danger they are facing, they would be willing to do anything to save their families. Even if it means giving up everything they hold dear."
 nef_council.16.a:0 "Death to tyrants!"
 nef_council.16.b:0 "Stand behind me, and fight!"
 nef_council.16.c:0 "Fear is Hope."
 nef_council.17.t:0 "The Beacon of Hope"
 nef_council.17.d:0 "The Grand Council of [Root.GetName] has come to an end. [Root.GetLeader] has gained the full support of the country. Granted sweeping emergency powers, yet making the oath to preserve the freedom and dignity of mankind, it is now up to him and his closest advisors to defend the country against foreign invasion."
 nef_council.17.a:0 "We will be victorious."
 nef_council.18.t:0 "The Strong Survive"
 nef_council.18.d:0 "The Grand Council of [Root.GetName] has come to an end. [Root.GetLeader] has tightened his grip on power, having silenced his most vocal critics. With extensive emergency powers at his command and very little standing in his way, he now offers a message of hope for the future, should only the people be willing to follow him and fight for it to their dying breaths."
 nef_council.18.a:0 "We will be victorious."
 nef_council.19.t:0 "The Abyss Stares Back"
 nef_council.19.d:0 "The Grand Council of [Root.GetName] has come to an end. [Root.GetLeader] has removed all obstacles from his path by ensuring the council exists only to reinforce his will. As fear spreads across the country, he will capitalize on it, using it to mold society into a weapon that can strike back at the enemy. The world is changing, and those who do not embrace this change will become its victims."
 nef_council.19.a:0 "I will be victorious."
 nef_council.20.t:0 "Hidden Event"
 nef_council.20.d:0 "You shouldn't be seeing this."
 nef_council.20.a:0 "Oh, my bad."
