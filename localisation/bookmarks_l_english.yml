 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "The State of the World"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Final Indoctrination / Divided States"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The year is 1980. Each totalitarian faction is split into five countries.\nNuclear warfare has ravaged much of the world, and from the ashes came the new world order. The three remaining super-states vie for global domination: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, and between them lies the Disputed Zone.\nOn January 1st, 1984, the armistice shall expire and the world will once again be consumed in total war. Only one state can be victorious - until the war begins again."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the great liberation armies advanced westwards, the western Mediterranean peoples were the first to rise up against the Nazi regimes. The Revolutionary Soviet Republics are ready and willing to spread Neo-Bolshevism across the Atlantic."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Eastern North America was struck particularly hard towards the end of the great nuclear war, and has come to be known as 'Ashland' by its inhabitants. The government of Oceania has divided these wastelands into thirteen sectors, and today a semi-autonomous colonial government continues the long process of reconstruction. High infant mortality rates and lower lifespans aside, these American territories are an integral part of the Oceanian war machine."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Having been ravaged by the Nazis and then again by the nuclear missiles of the mongoloid Neo-Bolsheviks, the people of the British Isles found their salvation in the Party and drove the invaders from their shores. Today, Airstrip One stands above the carnage and is ready to strike back."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once the home of the Nazi empire, the glorious liberation armies and nuclear missiles of the great alliance freed the peoples of Continental Europe and showed them the true path of the Neo-Bolshevist Party. The time has now come to liberate others until only the Party remains."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although relatively untouched by the Bolshevik nuclear arsenal, the Chinese people have seen more than their share of grueling wars of attrition over the last few decades. They have finally established regional dominance and proclaimed themselves as Overlord of Eastasia. With threats lurking at their borders, it may be time to go on the offensive once again."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Having been subjected to the great nuclear arsenal of China, the Japanese people now serve their overlords on the mainland as a part of the great Eastasian war machine. Old enemies are now lurking again across the Pacific, and once again the Japanese Navy will be counted upon to strike hard against this threat to secure the future of their society."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although their histories are revered in Eurasia, the Russian peoples were nearly broken on numerous occassions, warring against the Nazi empire and among themselves. They have finally found unity under the banner of Neo-Bolshevism, and the time has nearly come once again to liberate the world and to bring the love of the Party to all."
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Frontier sectors sit in a precarious position. The conquest of Africa has stalled as our forces were pushed back toward the southern end of the continent. Meanwhile, our territories in the Pacific lie under threat of naval invasion from Eastasia. These territories are strategically positioned, however, to launch naval invasions against the richest areas of the Disputed Zone."
 NEP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Himalayas and surrounding territories benefitted greatly from the population exodus during the wars in Europe. The infrastructure has greatly improved, and now a new Silk Road connects the heart of Eastasia to the lands of Persia. The mountains will provide us a defensive barrier, but we must be well-guarded against letting our supply lines to the west be cut off."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A total of twenty nations across four factions vie for global domination. In the end, only one faction can be victorious."
 GATHERING_STORM2_NAME:0 "Final Indoctrination / Standard"
 GATHERING_STORM2_DESC:0 "The year is 1980. Each totalitarian faction consists of one giant country.\nNuclear warfare has ravaged much of the world, and from the ashes came the new world order. The three remaining super-states vie for global domination: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, and between them lies the Disputed Zone.\nOn January 1st, 1984, the armistice shall expire and the world will once again be consumed in total war. Only one state can be victorious - until the war begins again."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM2_DESC:0 "After decades of brutal ground warfare and constant nuclear bombardments, the great liberation armies of Eurasia have finally defeated the enemies of Neo-Bolshevism in Europe and northern Asia. The time has now come to look outward and show others the love of Mother Russia and to realize the utopia of the Neo-Bolshevik society."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM2_DESC:0 "Suffering from mass genocide and slavery during the brutal occupation of the fascists, the peoples of Eastasia found their salvation through complete obliteration of the self. As one entity, under the leadership of their Immortal Father, they rose up and turned the fascists' nuclear arsenal against them. Although this victory was only recent, the armies of Eastasia are already primed for the next great struggle against the false ideologies of Oceania and Eurasia."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM2_DESC:0 "After the first Nazi atom bomb fell on London, many more quickly followed and it was not long until the eastern United States turned into a desolate wasteland. During the brief occupation, the people of England rallied around a new ideology they called English ingsoc and they struck back against the weakened Nazis. Now all nations of Oceania are united and victorious, and through the love of Big Brother and the Party they act as one entity, a totally homogenous society where the falsehoods become truth and the despair becomes sublime. But to keep this society together, war is inevitable."
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "First the colonial powers, then the fascists - Africa's resources have long been the target of greedy Europeans. The latest invaders preached Ingsoc and Neo-Bolshevism, but when the Ghost of Cairo began to destroy entire armies overnight, the people of Africa united under a new ideology: Freedom at all costs. Now they must hold against invasion across the Mediterranean and liberate those in the southern frontier zone."
 SAU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the Neo-Bolshevik revolution spread across Eurasia, the Arab world faced their own struggles. Desperation forced them to make comprimises when possible, and warfare when not. The nations soon united under the leadership of a man they called the Lion of Riyadh. Much like Khalid ibn al-Walid, he has never lost a battle. But as the Neo-Bolsheviks gather in Anatolia and the Death Worshippers gaze across the Shatt al-Arab with greed in their eyes, it is now clear that the most perilous battles are yet to come."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The last true democracy of the world died when the Death Worshippers seized Delhi and Mumbai. Preparations were being made for an unconditional surrender when the enemy fell into a trap. As their armies became separated, the Tiger of Mumbai managed to encircle and destroy them, piece by piece. Realizing that only ruthless warfare and decisive action could save them from a future invasion, the Prime Minister resigned and Parliament transferred sweeping emergency powers to their new leader. As a new invasion is imminent, the question remains if these powers will be enough to save India."
 SIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The vast jungles and mountains of Indochina, effective as they may be, are only the second line of defense. The people of this region have always guarded their independence with the utmost ferocity, and many empires have found nothing but shame and death in their repeated attempts to colonize these lands. Now the many cultures of Indochina have joined together under the leadership of the Viper of Saigon, and they will not hesitate to use every means at their disposal to help the Death Worshippers live up to the literal meaning of their name."
 INS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the world descended into chaos, the people of Indonesia freed themselves from European occupation and began to seize warships from across the Pacific. As these islands have been plundered by Europeans for generations, it is only a matter of time before the Oceanians and the Eastasians come for the vast strategic resources and enslavement of the population. With the seas as his shield, the Shark of Jakarta will defend these islands at all costs."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "The Forever War / Standard"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "THIS BOOKMARK IS IN PROGRESS! IT IS FOR TESTING ONLY! DON'T USE IT!\nLiberty has fallen. The last of the free nations are on the brink of collapse, fighting to the last soul. Meanwhile, the great armies of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia prepare to embark on the final global war to seal the fate of humanity.\nThe armistice between the great powers shall expire in thirty days. Then, the trumpets will sound again, and mankind will become locked in endless battle against itself, and the flames of war will consume the Earth - forever."
