 nef_dec_res_despdefense_RAJ_tt:0 "This afternoon, the men and women of India, citizens and refugees alike, gathered in public areas to listen to a broadcast from their leader.\n\nSpeaking to an infantry battalion from atop a charred vehicle, the Tiger of Mumbai pointed at the cracked and burned insignia on its hood. 'The symbol of our invader's ideology, their justification for their rights of conquest against us, cracks and burns like any other of mankind's creations. Their vehicles are numerous, but they break down and they fall victim to our mines. Their soldiers march against us by the million, but they envy us for our humanity and, in the end, choke on their own blood for a worthless cause.'\n\n'Freedom is the very air we breathe. It is the blood in our veins, the very essence of humanity. And humanity will never die, not until the Earth is swallowed by the Sun. These monsters believe they can triumph, but they are fighting their own ignorance. They are enslaving their own grandchildren.'\n\n'The time has come to strike back. Men and women of India, follow me and fight! Let us live our finest hour and show these fools how to fight a real war!'"
 nef_dec_res_despdefense_SIA_tt:0 "In cities along the coast, in mountain villages and in jungle camps, thousands of people gathered to listen to a broadcast from their leader. The Viper of Saigon delivered his radio address from an unknown location.\n\n'Ladies and gentlemen,' he began. 'I speak to you now during a time of great peril. It is a time of unprecedented bloodshed and suffering. It is not what we wished for, and it is not what we wished for our children.'\n\n'Fear has taken us into her grasp, and her cold hands tighten around our hearts. But this has awoken something within us that we always knew to be there, but dignity kept us from revealing. We, the people of a hundred cultures and languages, thousands of years of history and greatness, have a demon in our hearts that we have kept hidden from the gentle people of this world. And now the evil men of bastard nations have come to destroy that which we are. Those who worship death, the Ingsoc fools and even the Neo-Bolsheviks.'\n\n'Those fools have decided now is the time to wake our demons. But now is the time for them to see what truth looks like, for the first time in their lives. They believe they will find victory here, but they will only find death, and we can promise them that. They will all die in these jungles. Come, let us fulfill our promise."
 nef_dec_res_despdefense_ETH_tt:0 "As the sun set over the African continent this evening, tens of thousands of people gathered in public spaces to listen to a broadcast from their leader. Illuminated by torches, the Ghost of Cairo addressed a small crowd in the courtyard of a ruined palace.\n\n'Africa weeps for her children,' he said. 'For thousands of years, the world plundered Africa for her riches and for her people. The Romans salted the earth. The Europeans enslaved us. The mighty nations of the world fought each other to control us. This is where humanity was born. And now they wish for this to be where humanity dies.'\n\n'The invaders who come at us from the seas, from the skies, from the land; they are not humans. They are nothing but the tools of a machine that seeks to snuff out the light of mankind. And we will break them.'\n\n'The tyrant machine wishes to enslave us, to rape humanity and to steal our children and our culture, our very future! But the night has come for them. Africa does not weep any more! Tonight, we stand up and we fight! We will drive them back to their cursed wastelands, and we will dismantle their infernal machines, and our fury will burn through the night like a firestorm!'"
 nef_dec_res_despdefense_INS_tt:0 "Across the archipelago of Indonesia, thousands of citizens and refugees gathered in public places to listen to a broadcast from their leader. A man spoke into a microphone from aboard a warship somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n'Greetings,' he said. 'I am the one who is called the Shark of Jakarta. By now, you have all heard the news that the invader has made landfall on some of our island shores. Our great fleet, assembled over many years and at great cost, has suffered losses which may not be easily recouped. Our allies suffer, too, at the hands of these beasts.'\n\n'The enemy does not realize, though, that these oceans still belong to us. And now the time has come for us to strike back. We will push them back to the beaches, and as they wait for their rescue which will never arrive, we will push them back into the seas and drown them like dogs.'\n\n'We are the bastion of the Pacific. And we are the bastion of the free world. When the world is reduced to ashes, the people of Indonesia will still thrive, and one day we will take this fight back to these dogs and wash the Earth with their blood!'"
 nef_dec_res_despdefense_SAU_tt:0 "Throughout the Arabian peninsula, men and women gathered in public places to listen to a broadcast from their leader. The Lion of Riyadh sat before a microphone brought to his bunker not far from the front lines.\n\n'People of free nations of the world,' he began, 'do not weep for your fallen brothers and sisters. Their sacrifices will be celebrated for thousands of years, because this is not the end. This cannot be the end, because it is God's will that we will be victorious.'\n\n'The enemy fights for a lie. They fight for Big Brother, for Mother Russia, for Immortal Father. Do they believe these idols are their God? They are not even real. They were invented by committees, created as tools to convince the ignorant of a greater good that comes from slaughtering all that which makes us human, that free will that God gave to us!'\n\n'We, the last free peoples of this world, are the Sword of God, and we will fight back with the roar of lions, we will cut down these false prophets, and we will be the light that drives away the darkness!"
 nef_resevent.5.t:0 "A Grim Realization"
 nef_resevent.5.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has become withdrawn. His closest advisors whisper concerns to each other that their great leader no longer sleeps at night. He has become quiet during recent war council meetings, absorbing the latest dire news with silence as he glares over reports, offering few clues as to his emotional state.\n\nThis morning, though, was different. After the most recent setback, a certain fire burns in his eyes. The situation may seem grim for [From.GetName], but perhaps soon something could be done about it."
