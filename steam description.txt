[h1] Mod Description [/h1]
Nuclear warfare has ravaged much of the world, and from the ashes came the new world order. The three remaining super-states vie for global domination: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, and between them lies the Disputed Zone. An armistice has been declared, but on January 1st, 1984, the truce shall expire and the second apocalyptic war will begin.
This mod utilizes the setting from the George Orwell novel “Nineteen Eighty-Four” to create, first a war to gather as much as the disputed territory as possible, and then an all-out war between Eurasia, Oceania, and Eastasia.

This mod is a port of the original mod made by bees. They have given me full permission to port. In the future, I plan to continue development adding more content than the original had.

Most DLCs should work, La Resistance's intel features may be bugged, but will be fixed at a later date.
